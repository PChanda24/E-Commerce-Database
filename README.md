# E-commerce Database Project

## Introduction
In a world increasingly driven by technology, e-commerce has become a cornerstone of modern shopping experiences. This project aims to develop an efficient database model for an e-commerce website to streamline data storage for customers, products, orders, payments, and more. By leveraging this model, the company can gain valuable insights and make informed business decisions.

## Key Learnings and Highlights
- Developed a normalized relational database schema to efficiently store and manage e-commerce data.
- Executed complex SQL queries to extract valuable insights, such as customer spending patterns and product popularity.
- Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) to perform data analysis and generate visualizations, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
- Implemented NoSQL collections in MongoDB, demonstrating flexibility in handling different types of data storage needs.
- Achieved data integrity and consistency through well-defined relationships and constraints.

## Skills and Topics Covered
- **Database Design**: Conceptual and relational modeling, including EER and UML diagrams.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Writing and optimizing queries, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures, to retrieve meaningful insights from the data like customer behavious, product sales and order statuses.
- **NoSQL Knowledge**: Creating and querying MongoDB collections to handle unstructured data, and executing aggregate queries.
- **Data Analysis**: Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to perform data analysis and visualization, and to represent data trends and patterns.
- **Data Integration**: Connecting MySQL with Python for seamless data retrieval, analysis and visualization.
- **Data Governance**: Ensuring data quality, accuracy, and consistency through validation techniques.

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust framework for managing e-commerce data, facilitating better inventory management, customer analysis, and overall business intelligence. The integration of SQL, NoSQL, and Python demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of modern data management techniques.
